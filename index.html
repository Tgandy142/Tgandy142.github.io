                    <p>I have been living in ohio for about 20 years now, programming on and off for about 5 years. I studied java at my highschool during 11th grade and during 12th grade I helped teach new students java in the same class while learning more advanced logic from the teacher on the side.</p>
                    <p>After highschool I Studied Computer Science at Wright State University for 6 months before leaving to come home and work as I was, in retrospect, not ready to leave home yet. Over the next 3 years i worked at a gas station and then did security work, all the while wanting to study programming again but was waiting for the time to be right.</p>
                    <p>In mid 2020 I Started studying at We Can Code It and began learning all the skills I needed to fulfill my dream and become a Full-Stack Developer!</p>

                            In this project, I worked with a team of 3 others to create a console application that allows the user to create a
                            Robotic or Organic Dog/Cat and interact with them in a number of ways; Play, and walk. With some specific interactions depending
                            on the type of pet, as well as the species; Maintenance for Robotic pets, and Feed for Organic pets. As well as implement a way for the user to
                            store multiple pets within a virtual shelter and then be able to interact with one or multiple pets at a time.
